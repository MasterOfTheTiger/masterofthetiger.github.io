My website. I used to host it with x10hosting.com, but now I am using GitHub Pages. 

View it at http://mtiger.tk

This website contains a lot of my projects and profiles across the web. It is a basic introduction to me and my programming skills. 
[My blog](https://masterofthetiger.blogspot.com), on the other hand, contains updates on what I am working on.
