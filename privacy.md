# Privacy
This page explains what information I collect through my websites and other services, and explains what I do with it and why.

## Trackers
My [blog](https://blog.mtiger.tk] uses Google Analytics as it is built into Blogger.

I use this information to tell when visitors use my blog, how many, and where they are. This information is not sold or otherwise distributed to anyone else.

See Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) for information on what they do with that data.

Note: I do not use analytics on any other website unless otherwise stated. If there is trackers on any other of my sites and I have not "otherwise stated" please alert me and I will either remove the trackers or state that I use them. 

I use trackers on other sites mainly because they are built into the system.

## Cookies
I do not use cookies on any of my sites which I host with GitHub. These websites are anything in which the URL starts with `https://mtiger.tk/`. 

Cookies are used on my [blog](https://blog.mtiger.tk]

I do not use cookies on `mtig.tk` either.

I use cookies for simple operations (like polls) on my blog (`blog.mtiger.tk`).

This policy can be updated with or without notification. The last time this was updated is noted at the top of the page. If you would like to view a history of this privacy policy, please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MasterOfTheTiger/masterofthetiger.github.io) for my website.
