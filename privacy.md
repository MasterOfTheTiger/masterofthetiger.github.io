# Privacy
This page explains what information I collect through my websites and other services, and explains what I do with it and why.

*Last updated 2018-04-13*

## Google Analytics
My homepage ([mtiger.tk](https://mtiger.tk)) contains Google Analytics trackers which collect non-sensitive information about you whenever you visit that website. I also have Google Analytics installed (via Blogger) on [my blog](https://blog.mtiger.tk). 

I use this information to tell when visitors use my site, how many, and where they are. This information is not sold or otherwise distributed to anyone else.

See Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) for information on what they do with that data.

## Cookies
I do not use cookies on any of my sites which I host with GitHub. These websites are anything in which the URL starts with `https://mtiger.tk/`. This does not include websites that are under a different subdomain (i.e `blog.mtiger.tk`). 

I do not use cookies on `mtig.tk` either.

I use cookies for simple operations (like polls) on my blog (`blog.mtiger.tk`).

## Updating the Privacy Policy
This policy can be updated with or without notification. The last time this was updated is noted at the top of the page. If you would like to view a history of this privacy policy, please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MasterOfTheTiger/masterofthetiger.github.io) for my website.
