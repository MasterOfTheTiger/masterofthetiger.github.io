## Trackers
As far as I know, websites which I run do not have any third party analytics software installed.

## Cookies
I do not use cookies on any of my sites which I host with GitHub. These websites are anything in which the URL starts with `https://mtiger.xyz/`. 

I do not use cookies on `mtig.tk`.
