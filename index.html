        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
        <p>I am simply a teen web developer that follows Jesus. I want to use my programming abilities to serve the Lord.</p>
        <p>Technologies I know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unix-like systems in general</li>
            <li>HTML5 (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I use web technologies every day, and know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript very well. I know some PHP and I have been using it recently. I know some Python and use it for the occasional script. I know minimal C++, but I haven't used it in a while.</p>
        <p>I am very interested in cryptography and law (especially when it comes to intillectual property). </p>
        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>These are some examples of some of the work I have done.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://heb12.github.io">Heb12</a></h3>
        <p>Heb12 is a project I set up in April 2018 to build Bible apps for all sorts of devices. Heb12 is short for Hebrews 4:12, which reads</p>
        <blockquote>For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</blockquote>
        <p>God's word is so powerful, and Heb12's goal is to bring the word of God to easily be read in all sorts of devices as a free (libre) and open source software.</p>
        <p>There is currently only a desktop app for Heb12 that runs on Windows and GNU/Linux. You can get it at the <a href="https://github.com/heb12/heb12-desktop/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://librecheck.github.io">LibreCheck</a></h3>
        <p>LibreCheck is a easy and simple child check in program for places like churches and daycares. A lot of software is not only complex and hard to use, but are also prone to bugs. </p>
        <p>It is in its early stages in development, but you can go to its <a href="https://gitlab.com/librecheck">GitHub page</a> for more information. I might use LibreCheck to earn money for Heb12 by selling it to churches.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="/Bible-Compare">BibleCompare</a></h3>
        <p>This is a simple Bible chapter comparing website I made in a few minutes to figure out whether 2nd or 3rd John was longer. It compares characters and words.</p>
