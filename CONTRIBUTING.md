# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute if they follow these conditions.

## Content
The actual content of my website is to be made by me (@MasterOfTheTiger). Please refrain from editing anything content related on the website, such as pictures and paragraphs.

## Maintaining the Original
Your changes must not change the basic style of the website, please do not make major changes to the way the page looks.

## For personal use
I do not recommend forking this website for your own personal website. Instead, get the original template from [here](http://htmlcoder.me).

## Stability
If for some reason something on the site is broken because of your changes, they need to be fixed before being merged.

There really should not be much that needs to be changed by anyone but me. Best thing you can do is open an issue. 

If your changes follow those guidelines, they will likely be accepted.
